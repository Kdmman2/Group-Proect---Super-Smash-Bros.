	The Super Smash Bros. series is a series of crossover fighting games published by Nintendo,
	featuring characters from franchises created on Nintendo systems.
	The series had a successful start in 1999 with the game Super Smash Bros. released on the Nintendo 64.
	Since then there has been a Smash Bros. game on every Nintendo console and they have all had success.
	Masahiro Sakurai is the creator of the Kirby games from Nintendo and is also responsible for creating and
	being the lead programmer for the Super Smash Bros. series. He wanted to make a casual fighting game that can be
	enjoyed by everyone and has since been praised for his inovative design in the Super Smash Bros. games. In the Super Smash Bros.
	game characters try to knock eachother off the stage and the last player standing is the winner. Everytime a player gets hit
	their percentage goes up and then they will be knocked further off stage than before. Their are unlockable characters in every game
	as well as plenty of other modes besides the popular Vs mode that allow plenty of replayability.
